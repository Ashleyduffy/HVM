<h2>MESSAGE FROM<br>THE CREATOR</h2>
<p>“When I was sixteen years old, I envisioned a battle: Heart vs. Mind®. I immediately discovered that my life’s purpose is to broaden the perspectives of the masses by sharing this epiphany. Within each and every decision one makes in their lifetime lies a battle between the Heart and the Mind. While making decisions, one must seek the ideal balance between their thoughts and feelings, in order to achieve the most successful outcome. The Heart vs. Mind® movement represents a declaration of one’s own acceptance and mastery of this internal battle. Although it differs for everyone, my key piece of advice is: Lead With Your Heart and Let Your Mind Follow!” <br>– Isaac Abreu</p>
